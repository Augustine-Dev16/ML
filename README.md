# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains four machine learning projects implemented in Python, each focusing on different datasets and algorithms. The projects demonstrate techniques such as linear regression, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and random forest classification. Each project is organized in its own folder, containing the Python script and a dedicated README with detailed instructions.

## Projects
1. **CO2 Emissions Prediction**  
   Uses simple linear regression to predict CO2 emissions based on input features.  
   [View Details](co2_emissions/README.md)

2. **Digit Classifier**  
   Implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize handwritten digits.  
   [View Details](digit_classifier/README.md)

3. **House Price Prediction**  
   Applies XGBoost to predict house prices using various property features.  
   [View Details](house_prediction/README.md)

4. **Breast Cancer Classification**  
   Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant or benign) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
   [View Details](breast_cancer/README.md)

## Requirements
To run the projects, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn xgboost
```
Check each project's README for specific dependencies if applicable.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
2. Navigate to a project folder (e.g., `cd co2_emissions`) and refer to its `README.md` for specific instructions on running the script.
